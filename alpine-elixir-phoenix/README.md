# Alpine + Elixir + Phoenix

This image is based on the [elixir:1.7.2-alpine](https://hub.docker.com/_/elixir/) image. On top of this, it has `rebar`, `hex`, and [phoenix 1.3.4](https://github.com/phoenixframework/phoenix/tree/v1.3.4) installed.

It also includes a `wait-for` script at the root level.
