# Alpine + Gcloud + Helm + Helm-Push

This image is based on the [alpine:latest](https://hub.docker.com/_/alpine/) image. On top of this, it has `gcloud`, `kubectl`, and `helm` CLI tools installed.

It also has the [helm-push](https://github.com/chartmuseum/helm-push) plugin installed to make automation of pushing charts easier.
